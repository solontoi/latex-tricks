# latex-tricks
A repository of various useful latex things I have made
Current contents:

###AtwoodsMachine.tex
A tikz figure of a three-mass Atwood's machine. Pretty easy to fidget with the positions of the masses, pulleys and strings in order to make figures for other Atwood's Machines.

###d-bar.tex
While writing up material on thermal physics, I couldn't find a satisfactory "d-bar" symbol for use in improper derivatives, so I made one, defined by the new command here.

###sideimage.tex
I'm sad that \wrapfig doesn't work inside of enumerate or itemize environments, so I mashed up a pair of minipages as shown in this file that place an image to the right or left of an item in an enumerated list. I use this a lot in writing problem sets.
