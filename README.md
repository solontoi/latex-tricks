# latex-tricks
A repository of various useful latex things I have made

Current contents:

#### AtwoodsMachine.tex
A tikz figure of a three-mass Atwood's machine. Pretty easy to fidget with the positions of the masses, pulleys and strings in order to make figures for other Atwood's Machines.

#### d-bar.tex
While writing up material on thermal physics, I couldn't find a satisfactory "d-bar" symbol for use in improper derivatives, so I made one, defined by the new command here.

#### dogdirt.tex
I like custom math symbols. This is an example of defines an image file as the symbol. Here I define \poop as the unicode "dog dirt" image. I trimmed the raw graphic a bit to fit inline better. There are better ways of getting unicode characters into a document, but this works for any image.

#### exambox.tex
Snipet of latex to draw a nice box for students to write their answer in for exams.

#### letterhead.tex
Proper syntax to use the wallpaper package to make a specified .pdf the background image for a document. I use this to write letters on a .pdf of the college letterhead, hence the filename.

#### RomanNum.tex
I sometimes want to write roman numerals without it looking like the capital I and V of the current font, this uses more distinctive glyphs for them.

#### sideimage.tex
I'm sad that \wrapfig doesn't work inside of enumerate or itemize environments, so I mashed up a pair of minipages as shown in this file that place an image to the right or left of an item in an enumerated list. I use this a lot in writing problem sets.

#### twitter.tex
Command for instering the twitter bird symbol for twitter handles in tex
