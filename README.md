# latex-tricks
A repository of various useful latex things I have made
Current contents:

###AtwoodsMachine.tex
A tikz figure of a three-mass Atwood's machine. Pretty easy to fidget with the positions of the masses, pulleys and strings in order to make figures for other Atwood's Machines.

###d-bar.tex
While writing up material on thermal physics, I couldn't find a satisfactory "d-bar" symbol for use in improper derivatives, so I made one, defined by the new command here.
